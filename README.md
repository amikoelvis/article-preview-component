## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced how to create **responsive layouts** using **Flexbox**, and I learned how to implement a **share button toggle** functionality with simple JavaScript event listeners.

Here’s an example of the toggle functionality:

```js
const shareButton = document.querySelector('.share-button');
const shareOptions = document.querySelector('.share-options');

shareButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  shareOptions.classList.toggle('visible');
});


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my accessibility practices (e.g., using aria-* attributes).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me with the styling.
